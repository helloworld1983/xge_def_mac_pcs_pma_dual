--
-- SHORT DESCRIPTION: 10 GIGABIT ETHERNET EXAMPLE DESIGN (MAC+PHY, DUAL PORT)
--
-- LONG DESCRIPTION: THIS IS AN EXAMPLE DESIGN IS DERIVED FROM WRAPPING OF TWO
--  INDEPENDENT XILINX VIVADO IP CORE EXAMPLE DESIGNS OF THE 10 GIGABIT ETHERNET
--  SUBSYSTEM (REFER TO PG157). THE TWO CORES INSTANTIATED ARE OF DIFFERENT
--  CONFIGURATION. TO NAME, THE AXI_10G_ETHERNET_MASTER IS INSTANTIATED AS
--  "INCLUDE SHARED LOGIC IN THE CORE", AND THE AXI_10G_ETHERNET_SLAVE IS
--  INSTANTIATED AS "INCLUDE SHARED LOGIC IN THE EXAMPLE DESIGN". THE "SHARED
--  LOGIC" REFERS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE COMPONENT RESOLVING THE DIFFERENTIAL
--  CLOCK. IN SHORT, THE SHARED LOGIC BEING THE COMMON COMPONENTS SHARED BY THE
--  HIGH SPEED SERIAL (GT) PORTS OF THE SAME GT QUAD. HENCE, AT MOST FOUR 10GBE
--  PORTS CAN SHARE A SINGLE, COMMON SHARED LOGIC. IN MORE TECHNICAL TERM, EACH
--  TRANSCEIVER (PORT) IS ASSOCIATED WITH A GT_CHANNEL LOGIC BLOCK, AND IF THE
--  FOUR GT_CHANNEL ARE WITHIN THE SAME GT QUAD, THEY CAN SHARE A SINGLE COMMON
--  GT_COMMON BLOCK.
--
--  IN REAL, BOTH PATH WILL RESULT IN A WORKING 10GB ETHERNET SUBSYSTEM. THEY
--  DIFFER ONLY IN THAT THE SHARED LOGIC IS ENCAPSULATED IN THE LOCKED IP CORE
--  OR THE SHARED LOGIC HAS TO BE EXPLICITLY CREATED IN THE PROJECT CODE.
--
--  IN THIS EXAMPLE DESIGN, THE PROJECT IS AS SAID, CREATED FROM TWO EXAMPLE
--  DESIGNS OF THE TWO CONFIGURATIONS INSTEAD OF RAW IP CORE BLOCKS OF THE TWO.
--  THE MASTER (AS AN EXAMPLE DESIGN) INCLUDES THE GT_COMMON BLOCK WITHIN THE
--  IP CORE LOGIC, AND THE SLAVE (ALSO AS AN EXAMPLE DESIGN) INCLUDES THE
--  GT_COMMON BLOCK WITHIN THE EXAMPLE DESIGN PROJECT CODE GENERATED. THUS,
--  ONE OF THEM IS REDUNDANT AND THE SLAVE WAS CHOSEN TO HAVE THE SHARED LOGIC
--  ELIMINATED AS THE SHARED LOGIC IS EXPOSED IN CODE IN THAT PART OF THE
--  EXAMPLE DESIGN PROJECT. BOTH THE MASTER PART AND THE SLAVE PART EXAMPLE
--  DESIGN CODE IS FURTHER MODIFIED SO THE SHARED LOGIC SIGNALS, E.G., THE
--  RESOLVED DIFFERENTIAL CLOCK OF THE TRANSCEIVER BLOCK CAN BE EXPOSED FROM THE
--  MASTER END AND ACCEPTED AT THE SLAVE END.
--
--  AGAIN, IT CAN BE THAT BOTH "MASTER" AND "SLAVE" ARE CREATED AS "INCLUDE
--  SHARED LOGIC IN THE EXAMPLE DESIGN". THEN, ELIMINATE THE SLAVE SIDE SHARED
--  LOGIC AND CONNECT THE SLAVE SIDE CLOCK SIGNALS, ETC., TO THE SO CALLED
--  "MASTER", I.E., THE BLOCK THAT PROVIDES THE SHARED LOGIC. IT SHOULD BE NOTED
--  THAT, AS A GT QUAD ACCOMMODATES FOUR TRANCEIVERS, THEREFORE, ONE "MASTER"
--  CAN DRIVE THREE MORE "SLAVES" IF THEY ALL RESIDE IN THE SAME QUAD.
--
--  THIS EXAMPLE DESIGN IS CREATED FOR THE ALPHA DATA ADM-PCIE-7V3 THAT COMES
--  WITH 2 10GBE PORTS. TO OPERATE, CONSULT THE IMAGE "vio.png" INCLUDED IN THE
--  ASSOCIATED DIRECTORY "doc". THE SRC_ADDR CONFIGURES THE TWO 10GBE PORTS MAC
--  ADDRESS. THE INPUT TAKES ONE FULL MAC ADDRESS, DIS-REGARDING THE LAST BIT,
--  AND THE CODE WILL DIFFERENTIATE THE TWO PORTS BY SETTING PORT 0 WITH THE
--  LAST BIT '0' AND PORT 1 WITH LAST BIT '1'. E.G., SRC_ADDR CONFIGURED AS
--  "000504030201" WILL RESULT IN PORT 0 AS "00:05:04:03:02:00" AND PORT 1 AS
--  "00:05:04:03:02:01", THE LAST DIGIT '1' IN BINARY FORM BEING 0001 AND HAS
--  NO EFFECT IN DETERMINING THE ADDRESS AS THE LAST BIT IS MASKED.
--
--  THE *_DEST_ADDR SETS THE DESTINATION MAC ADDRESS EACH PORT IS DELIVERING
--  THEIR GENERATED PACKETS TO. RESET_ERROR, WHEN SET TO 1 CLEARS THE ERROR
--  REGISTER. RESET, WHEN SET TO 1 RESET/STOP THE TEST AND WHEN SET TO 0 STARTS
--  GENERATING PACKETS AT BOTH MASTER AND SLAVE TO BE DELIVERED TO THEIR
--  SPECIFIED DESTINATIONS.
